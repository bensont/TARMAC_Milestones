## *Milestone 1*
***
### *Team Name:* TARMAC
***
### *Description:*
__The Stockpile__ is a webstore that provides fine hand-crafted Canadian furniture and goods to customers around the world.  We pride ourselves on our family-owned, grassroots business model that gives our customers excellent customer service, and an experience that they will want to come back to every time that they need furniture.

Our web store is the first step in giving customers the next piece that they need to complete that living room or kitchen set.  The easy-to-navigate interface guides customers through the shopping process.  Once in the cart, we do our best to give the lowest shipping costs possible and there’s no assembly required!  Say goodbye to wrestling with IKEA furniture for a whole weekend.

Along with customers users, we also provide employees at Stockpile headquarters in Toronto with the ability to add and edit products easily from an Employee interface, separated from the store.  Our employees don’t need to worry about writing code or markdown to change the website, with the simple click of a button they can make edits and expand the website.  This allows for an expandable store.

### *Vision Statement:*

The vision for __The Stockpile__ to provide users with a sleek, modern shopping experience to buy beautiful pre-assembled furniture that will last for a lifetime.
***
### *Motivation:*

We are developing this app because the world deserves easy access to quality craftsmanship without the hassles that come with large warehouse stores. We find that many web applications are difficult to navigate which is why we also aim to provide a quality user experience that is simple and intuitive. No ads - just fine furniture.

### *Risks:*

The risk that would prevent the project from completing on time will include the lack of experience from some of our team's members. Another risk factor is the lack of time some of our members can place into the project.  One risk that is inherent with all group projects, not just a coding project, is the ability for group members to meet on time at a scheduled meeting place.  With six people in a group, there’s going to be scheduling conflicts and that’s just a given.  Another issue that could lead to the failure of this project is time constraints and keeping a reasonable scope for the allotted amount of time that we are given to complete the project.
