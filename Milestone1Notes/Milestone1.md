## *Milestone 1*
### *Team Name:* TARMAC
### *Team Members:* Colin Craighead, Tyler Benson, Maureen Aubrey, Alex Kennedy, Ahman Woods, Rebecca Donohoe 
***
### *Description:*
__The Stockpile__ is a webstore that provides fine hand-crafted Canadian furniture and goods to customers around the world.  We pride ourselves on our family-owned, grassroots business model that gives our customers excellent customer service, and an experience that they will want to come back to every time that they need furniture.

Our web store is the first step in giving customers the next piece that they need to complete that living room or kitchen set.  The easy-to-navigate interface guides customers through the shopping process.  Once in the cart, we do our best to give the lowest shipping costs possible and there’s no assembly required!  Say goodbye to wrestling with IKEA furniture for a whole weekend.

Along with customers users, we also provide employees at Stockpile headquarters in Toronto with the ability to add and edit products easily from an Employee interface, separated from the store.  Our employees don’t need to worry about writing code or markdown to change the website, with the simple click of a button they can make edits and expand the website.  This allows for an expandable store.
***
### *Vision Statement:*
The vision for __The Stockpile__ to provide users with a sleek, modern shopping experience to buy beautiful pre-assembled furniture that will last for a lifetime.
***
### *Motivation:*
We are developing this app because the world deserves easy access to quality craftsmanship without the hassles that come with large warehouse stores. We find that many web applications are difficult to navigate which is why we also aim to provide a quality user experience that is simple and intuitive. No ads - just fine furniture.

### *Risks:*
The risk that would prevent the project from completing on time will include the lack of experience from some of our team's members. Another risk factor is the lack of time some of our members can place into the project.  One risk that is inherent with all group projects, not just a coding project, is the ability for group members to meet on time at a scheduled meeting place.  With six people in a group, there’s going to be scheduling conflicts and that’s just a given.  Another issue that could lead to the failure of this project is time constraints and keeping a reasonable scope for the allotted amount of time that we are given to complete the project.
***
### *Risk Mitigation Plan:*
1. Weekly meetings to help keep people on track and keep them working on what has been assigned to them that week.
2. Assign work dependent on both work schedule and experience.
3. Have the week projects’ be completed by two people which will have meetings outside the general meetings. 3 projects for each week which each group will get one project
4. Each general meeting, the group rotates bring food.
5. Have list of requirements in order of priority

### *Development Methods:*
The group methodology which this group will be using is Agile. Agile is a methodology of satisfying the customer with early and continuous updates of the project. Agile is known for having competitive advantage with interaction between buyer and company allowing for heavy changes in the projects late into development and having the design be set in stone as late as possible in the game. This includes smaller projects throughout the entire projects lifetime. It is the idea of building it, assessing it, modifying it and then repeat. The Agile method is a way to be flexible and dynamic and still keep in budget and in time given along with making sure that the project is completed and works properly. This method will allow for more flexibility and to be able to be apdatpte late in the game if the project needs modification and to catch project issues earlier on.

### *Collaboration Tool:*
We have chosen Discord to communicate because it allows remote collaboration in real time through both text and voice chat, and video chat.
***
### *Proposed Architecture:*
For the Stockpile website we will need to develop a front end web store that will allow users to be able to login, scroll through products, add these products to a cart, and pay for these products. These screens will need to be laid out in a way the users can easily understand what they are looking at. The site will need text, links, and pictures. HTML is a markup language that will allow us to structure text, images and links on our website. HTML is a great tool for structure but, the web site will look dull or bare. CSS will work hand in hand with HTML to add graphics to the structure to make our site easy on the eyes. JaveScript will allow for creation of interactive elements on our site.

The next Integration layer of the stack will need to link the front end of the web store to the database. Node.js is a language that will fit this role. Js can be embedded in to HTML to allow us to have more advanced logic in each page. Js will also process information entered by the user such as email/password. It will then process the data and send it to the database as well as take information from the database and process it so can be properly displayed.

The last layer of the integration stack is the database. This will need to store all of the products, user data, and orders. MySQL is a database language that stores all the data in organized tables. This data can be called on via keys. A well designed table is necessary to efficiently use the keys to find data and pass it back up the integration stack.
